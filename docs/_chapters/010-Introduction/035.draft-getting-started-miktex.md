## Installing MiKTeX

First we must install the MiKTeX base system. I am using here the *chocolatey* package manager.

``` cmd
choco install miktex -y
```

>*Note:* you should follow the post installation instructions from the original web site: [miktex-console](https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console)

## Generate the book

Then you can generate the PDF file from the generated tex file with the following command. 

``` cmd
pdflatex .\Shakespeare.tex
```

You will see an output like the following example. 

``` cmd
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.24 (MiKTeX 23.1) (preloaded format=pdflatex.fmt)
 restricted \write18 enabled.

Output written on Shakespeare.pdf (21 pages, 305827 bytes).
Transcript written on Shakespeare.log.
```

The book will be one PDF file you can view or print.

> *Note:* When you run this the very first time you need internet access, because some additional packages will be downloaded. This might take also some time.


## Viewing the book

There are two options to view the book. An PDF viewer like Acrobat or some modern browser or the texworks tool from the MiKTeX distribution. The big advantage is that the PDF is not locked and can be regenerated while the viewer is open. This allows a good streamlined workflow.

``` cmd
texworks .\Shakespeare.pdf
```
