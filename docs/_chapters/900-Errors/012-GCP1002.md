## Error GCP1002

**"In the context {baseRecord.Tag} The Tag {record.Tag} is not covered in the model"**

## Details

This warning is happening, because the parser read a TAG in the GEDCOM file which is not described in the model. This leads to tags which will be ignored.

## Background

There should be a property describing the meaning of an unknown Tag. This happens often when GEDCOM programs are extending the GEDCOM Standard with proprietary Tags.

## Solution

This must be fixed in the source code. Please provide the maintainer a sample GEDCOM File so that the internal model can describe the data.
