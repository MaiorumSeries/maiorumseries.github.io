## Error GCP1000

**{context.Line} In the record {baseRecord.Tag} the mapped typed record {type.Name} is mapping to a property {targetProperty.Name} which does not allow to map the sub records**

## Details

This error is happening, because the model description does not match the GEDCOM file. This will happen when the GEDCOM level indicates substructure which the current model does not support.

## Background

The Parser is working with an internal class model which is mapped with .NET attributes to the GEDCOM tags.

## Solution

This must be fixed in the source code. Please provide the maintainer a sample GEDCOM File so that the internal model can describe the data.
