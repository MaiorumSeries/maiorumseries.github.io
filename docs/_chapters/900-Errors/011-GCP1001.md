## Error GCP1001

**$"Record {record.Tag} has unprocessed property {targetProperty.Name}"**

## Details

This error is happening, because the model description does not match the GEDCOM description. This will happen when the GEDCOM structure tags can not be mapped to the internal strongly typed model. Typically a unknown aggregation is detected.

## Background

The Parser is working with an internal class model which is mapped with .NET attributes to the internal types which can not be mapped.

## Solution

This must be fixed in the source code. Please provide the maintainer a sample GEDCOM File so that the internal model can describe the data.
